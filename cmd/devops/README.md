## Building


### Compiling locally 

In order to build devops, you will need (packr)[https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr] to include the Golang files from the 
example [build/cicd](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/tree/master/build/cicd)


This repo has a post-commit hook at [githooks/post-commit](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/blob/master/githooks/post-commit) to detect changes to `build/cicd` tool.
